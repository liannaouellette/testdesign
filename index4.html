        <p class="Holo">1. Holocaust</p>
        <img src="/_110668777_gettyimages-89277106-1.jpeg" width="300" class="holo">
        <p class="H">The Holocaust, also known as the Shoah, was the genocide <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of European Jews during World War II. Between <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;  1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators <br> systematically murdered some six million Jews across <br>  German-occupied Europe; around two-thirds of Europe's <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jewish population.</p>
        <p class="Tor">2. Moses Receives Torah</p>
        <img src="/080304-science-moses-vlarge2-130p.webp" width="300" class="tor">
        <p class="x">It was at Mount Sinai where Moses, Judaism's <br> &nbsp;  most important prophet, received the Torah <br> &nbsp;  (which in Jewish terms means the first five <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; books of the Hebrew Bible), including the <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Ten Commandments.</p>
        <p class="Abra">3. Abraham arrives in the Land of Israel</p>
        <img src="/bb381f913627666e6e07b0a6fd641880.jpeg" width="300" class="abra">
        <p class="A">It was Abraham, the father of monotheism (a belief <br> in the One God) who was the first protagonist in the <br> &nbsp;fateful story of the Jews. Commanded by God to <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave his birthplace, he set off on a long and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arduous journey to the land of Israel. </p>
        <p class="era">4. The Eras of King David <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and King Solomon</p>
        <img src="/king-david-and-king-solomon-featured-in-a-stained-glass-window-in-CERC10.jpeg" class="Era" width="300">
        <p class="E">This really was a golden era, <br> by any standards. Named ‘the <br>&nbsp;United Monarchy’ period, it <br> &nbsp;refers to the United Israelite <br> kingdom of Israel and Judah, <br> during the reigns of Saul, David, <br>&nbsp; and Solomon, whose story is <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; told in the Hebrew Bible. </p>
